# Day 1

Today I have learned:

- There are 7 types of data that are meaningful to the computer: number
- Using assignment operator to give values to variables
- When the variables are first declared, they are initialized with the value of undefined
- Mathematical operation on undefined variables would return NaN (not a number)
- Concatenating a string with an undefined variable would return an undefined string
- Naming convention camelCase for variable names
- The difference between var, let, and const variable declaration keywords
  - var is easily overridden
  - let: variable with the same name can only be declared once.
  - const: read-only variable, cannot be reassigned. (naming convention is all uppercase - immutable variables)
- Basic operations in Javascript: multiplication, addition, subtraction, and division.
- Increasing a variable by one with shorthand: i++ and i-- for the opposite.
- Decimal numbers are the ones that have float points or called float.
- The remainder operator %, the difference between the modulus operator is that it does not work with negative numbers.
- Everything on the right side of the assignment will be evaluated first.
- Operators such as +=; -=; *=; /=
- Escaping literal quotes in a string by placing a backslash in front of the quote and escape sequence.
- Concatenation operator
- Using bracket notation to get a character at a specific index in a string.
